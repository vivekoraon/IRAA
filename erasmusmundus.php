				<h4>Erasmus Mundus Action 2 Project-INDIA-4EUII-EACEA/42/11</h4>
				<p>Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad has been selected for funding under Erasmus Mundus Project submitted under India 4EUII Framework based on the proposal submitted by Department of Mining Engineering in the month of April 2012. The project is being coordinated by Politecnico di Torino, Italy and co-coordinated by Amrita University, India. The programme envisages mobilities (student and academic staff) for higher education and research in various partners? universities in Europe (10 from Europe and 10 from India) as given below:</p>

				<p style="margin-top: 10px;">The funding of the mobilities for the 23 fellowships, covered subsistence allowance, travel costs, participation costs and insurance costs. For meeting the expenditure related to organisation/management of the project a lumpsum of 3000 euro was provided to ISM. Total funding to ISM under the project (assuming that all the fellowships are utilized) thus would be aroun 250 lakhs.</p>
				<p>This program is funded by European Commission. 10 prestigious universities namely Georg-August-Universität, Göttingen, Germany; Institute Polytechnique de Grenoble, France; Politecnico di Torino, Italy etc. are the partener universities with ISM for exchange studies and research.</p>
				<ul>

					<li>Doctoral Students completed: 4 (12 months)</li>
					<li>Faculty Members for Post-doc: 1 (12 months)</li>
					<li>Faculty exchange:2 (1 months)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The project is based on the mutual recognition of qualifications and credits taken in partner universities. It is expected that this will provide a global platform to our students to compete and pursue research and higher education in the fields of engineering and technology, sciences and management in some of the best European universities. Academic council and Executive Board of ISM approved the same and Ministry of Human Resource Development has been informed. The project is almost complete and 22 mobilities have been successfully completed.</p>
